      Hello! My name is Devin Brite.
      As a college student I'm involved in web development and programming.
      As a hobbyist, I make games. I also fight for personal freedoms -
      be that in the name of free software, social rights, privacy, or the open Internet.
      Despite being an advocate for privacy, I consider myself a very public person.
      Speaking of, you can find all my social media accounts at
      <a href="https://keybase.io/hd">https://keybase.io/hd</a>.
      Yes, all.

      Here's a brief history of me:
    </p>
	<p>
      I grew up in a town called Millville, Massachusetts.
      I moved to Grafton in my pre-teen years, and I've lived here since.
      I dropped out of high school, took a year off,
      and ended up with a diploma at the same time as my peers.
      <i>Eat that, world.</i>
      Now I have an Associate's in Science, majoring in Computer Information Systems.
    </p>

      Now let's talk technology.
      I'm most experienced with Java, but my favorite programming language is Rust.
      My least favorite is Visual Basic.
