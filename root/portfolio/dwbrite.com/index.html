<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>
    dwbrite.com is an adventure in css and web servers.
    That is to say, this website is written in Go using gorilla for routing.
    A crude form of caching is implemented for executed templates -
    and eventually I'll add a filewatcher to cache everything else proper.

    dwbrite.com used to be a Tumblr page where I wrote about my projects.
    I had taken a bit too much inspiration from a certain
    <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"><q>motherloving</q> website.</a>
    I wanted a bit more color, but I quite liked the layout as it was.
    The biggest change in the new version is the background.
    Blue, orange, and purple radial gradients merge into neutral tones to make reading easy on the eyes.
    And it's really pretty. Especially on tall pages.

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>
    I designed this website with two things in mind:
    <ol>
        <li>simple design language</li>
        <li>user friendliness</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    Simple design language means that interactive elements on the page should do what you expect,
    Things like self-descriptive buttons, and links being blue - including in navigation.
</p>
<p>
    User friendliness means not being actively hostile to the user.
    Pages should load quickly without unnecessary bloat.
    Media that isn't strictly required should be opt-in or lazy-loaded.
    Contents of a page should be visible without the need for javascript.
    Links should be links and not lead you to <a href="javascript:void 0;">garbage</a> when opened in a new tab.
    Things like that.
</p>

<h3 id="server">Under the hood</h3>
<p>
    The repo is split into source code and web content.
    Web content is maintained in the <i>`root`</i> folder.
    From there, each subdirectory can contain a <i>`metadata.json`</i> file
    which defines how the server should render its contents.
    A directory could be rendered as raw resources with a blacklist or whitelist,
    as a template executed with the contents of <i>`index.html`</i>,
    or as one of any other pre-made definitions.
    This allows for all kinds of fun tricks and easter eggs I may want to add in the future ;)
