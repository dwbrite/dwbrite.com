<p>Finished my “GifBackgroundifier”! Set an animated .gif as your background on a Windows computer!
    I think it’s pretty rad, and if you’d like to try it just ask.</p>

<p>If your GIF doesn’t work, try opening it in GIMP and exporting it to a new file with the highest quality.
    This is just the first version so I haven’t made an error popup,
    but you can tell if your GIF doesn’t work by if the loading bar moves or not.</p>

<p>Windows only, sorry.<br/></p>

<p>Feel free to send me ideas, suggestions, or complaints!<br/></p>

<p>Warning: This program uses a decent amount of processing power, about 12% on my laptop.<br/></p>
